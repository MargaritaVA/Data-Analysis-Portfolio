# Data Analysis Portfolio

*Welcome to my portfolio!*

I am passionate about continuous learning and thrive on using data to uncover trends, streamline processes, and create solutions to address business challenges. My journey in data analysis is built on a strong foundation in customer call center management and the fintech insurance sector, where I’ve sharpened my analytical skills. I’m continually expanding my technical expertise in all aspects of data.

In this portfolio, I’ve showcased a selection of personal projects that highlight my proficiency in **SQL**. Each project reflects my dedication to data-driven problem-solving and my ability to transform data into valuable insights.
