# Data Analysis Portfolio

*Welcome to my portfolio!*

I am passionate about continuous learning and enjoy leveraging data to uncover trends, streamline processes, and develop solutions that address complex business challenges. 
My journey in data analysis is driven by a strong foundation in customer relations and fintech insurance, where I've honed my skills and expanded my technical expertise.

This portfolio highlights a curated selection of projects that demonstrate my proficiency in **SQL**. 
Each project reflects my commitment to data-driven problem-solving and my ability to translate insights into actionable results.
