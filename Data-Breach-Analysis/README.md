## üåç World's Biggest Data Breaches Analysis 

* **Goal**: To analyze breaches reported from 2008 to 2022 to identify trends and patterns, providing insights into the evolving landscape of data security and breach incidents globally.
* **Code**: [Breach_Analysis.sql](https://github.com/MargaritaVA/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Data-Breach-Analysis/Code.sql)
* **Dataset**: [World's Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-and-hacks/data)
* **Description**: This project involved cleaning and analyzing raw data to uncover key insights related to data breaches. The analysis aimed to determine the total number of breaches, the total and percentage of records lost, identify trends over time, and pinpoint the most common breach methods. Additionally, it explored the industries most affected, identified companies with the highest record losses, assessed the impact of data sensitivity, examined the correlation between data sensitivity and breach methods, and analyzed discrepancies between actual and reported records.  
* **Skills**:
    * Data Cleaning: Utilize `RegEx` for filtering and `SUBSTRING_INDEX` for formatting data. Convert data types from `varchar` to `date` and `bigint` as needed. Apply `CASE` statements to standardise and update values, and remove unnecessary columns to optimize the dataset for analysis. 
    * Analysis: Employ subqueries, joins, aggregate functions, and window functions to perform comprehensive data analysis.
* **Technology**: MySQL Workbench, SQL.
* **Results**:
